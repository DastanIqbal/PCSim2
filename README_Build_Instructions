1. In src/META-INF/
   edit MANIFEST.FM_PCSim2, MANIFEST.MF_PARSER, MANIFEST.MF_SDT
   by replacing 
       build version : Specification-Version: x.x.xx-xxxx (e.g., 0.1.18-beta)
      
   The build process will automatically update
       repository number Implementation-Version: xxxx (e.g., 7242)

2. Ensure the templates directory is under bin/

3. If USING ANT to build then, in root directory, type 'ant'.


4. Rename the setup zip file, for example PCSim2_Setup-7242.zip


5. Install using setup executable and start PCSim2


6. Run regression test of templates and confirm everything passed.

   Note: You are using two instances of PCSim2, one is core, one is DUT.
   Verify the configuration files for both.

   Note: Scripts between CORE and DUT must be lined up in order.
   (DUT is in directory 'ut').
