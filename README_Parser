The Parser (pc2_parser-0.1.jar) application requires three packages to be included in the jar file.
These include the com.cablelabs.log, com.cablelabs.fsm, com.cablelabs.tools and com.cablelabs.parser. 

The MANIFEST to use when creating the jar file is located in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_PARSER. 
This file should be modified to include the Tortoise revision head used to construct 
the application. This information is included in any logs generated by the application 
for future platform issue management.

The Parser is dependent on several third-party libraries. Currently these are from the poi 
(vers. 2.5.1) and log4j (vers. 1.2.13) Apache/Jakarta open source libraries.
These are included under the lib directory.
An optional set of libraries come from jung(vers. 2.2.0.1) for visualizing parsed scripts.
These should be placed under lib/jung/* if the visualization feature is desired.

The Parser's zip file also include the config directory. At a minimum this directory 
should contain the LogConfig.txt file which is used by the log4j library to configure 
the debugging levels for various components within the Parser.
