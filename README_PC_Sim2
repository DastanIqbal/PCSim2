The PC Sim2 (PC_Sim2-0.1.jar) application requires all of  packages under the com, gov,  
 and javax directories. 

The MANIFEST to use when creating the jar file is located in META-INF/MANIFEST.MF_PCSim2. 
This file should be modified to include the Tortoise revision head used to construct 
the application. This information is included in any logs generated by the application 
for future platform issue management.

PC Sim2 is dependent on several third-party libraries. Currently these are from the poi 
(vers. 2.5.1) and log4j (vers. 1.2.13) Apache/Jakarta open source libraries. These are included
in the zip file under the lib directory.
An optional set of libraries come from jung(vers. 2.2.0.1) for visualizing parsed scripts.
These should be placed under lib/jung/* if the visualization feature is desired.

The PCSim2's zip file also include the config directory. At a minimum this directory 
should contain the LogConfig.txt file, server.pfx (server-side keystore for TLS),
client.pfx (client-side keystore for TLS), DUT.xls (example DUT configuration file)
and PLATFORM.xls (example Platform settings file). The LogConfig.txt is used by the
log4j library to configure the debugging levels for various components within the application.
The .pfx files are used for TLS negotiation. The .xls files are used to configure the 
settings for the test to be conducted.
